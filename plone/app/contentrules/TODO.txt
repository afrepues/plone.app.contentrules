============================
plone.app.contentrules to-do
============================

 Install via easy_install or symlinks to lib/python. You must install both
 plone.contentrules and plone.app.contentrules. You will also need the 
 Plone 3.0 bundle (or plip157 bundle) and Zope 2.10!
 
 Make sure you put a slug in etc/package-includes like 
 plone.app.portlets-configure.zcml, containing
 
  <include package="plone.app.contentrules" />

 To test, go to a regular Folder in Plone, and append @@manage-content-rules
 to the URL, e.g. http://localhost:8080/Plone/my-folder/@@manage-content-rules.

 Known issues
 ------------
 
  - Cancel button on add form still tries to execute validator
  
  - Add and edit forms don't use Plone styling
    -> need to integate with plone.app.form
    
 Design
 ------
 
  - Re-visit reliance on Node
      - consider pattern in zope.app.content, marking element interfaces like
        ILoggerAction with an IInterface like IRuleActionType
      - queryType() can find such interfaces
      - the interface may tell us enough about a type
          - how to get name, description of the element type?
          - how to get edit view (can rely on edit.html convention)

 Views
 -----
 
   - UI re-ordering rules?

 Actions
