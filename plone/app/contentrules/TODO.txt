============================
plone.app.contentrules to-do
============================

 Immediate tasks
 ---------------
 
  - Rule triggering is disabled. Need to re-enable, test and enable bubbling.
  - Need events to remove assignments when a rule is removed, keep track of
    references to assignments in rules.
    
  - Finish Manage elements, assignments UI
  
  - Make conditions into multi-selects where possible
  - Rules should have a "stop evaluating more rules" flag
  - Elements must explain their actions
  
  - Make "send email" action

 Known issues
 ------------
 
  - IObjectAddedEvent executes too early when using Archetypes content objects
    (before the object is initialised from user input, leading to various 
    errors with move-to-folder, copy-to-folder or transition-workflow as
    actions). Therefore, we are using IObjectInitializedEvent from AT, but 
    this is AT specific. Plain-CMF content types are probably a lost cause,
    because we don't have a well-defined event for when they are first 
    initialised. Zope 3 content types or anything with a proper add form
    would work with IObjectAddedEvent, but then the user would have to know
    which one to use.
    
    One option is to listen for IObjectAddedEvent and check for IBaseObject.
    When an AT object is received, delay executing the rule until a subsequent
    IObjectInitializedEvent is received for the same object in the same 
    request. This would still cause problems with plain-CMF content types,
    but would work with items with proper add forms.
    
    This may not be that much of an issue at this point in time, but may be
    going forward.
 
  - Move-to-folder, copy-to-folder actions require the user to know
    absolute Zope physical paths, which sucks. We need a decent selection
    wiget!
     
  - Tests for event handling not in place
        
 Design
 ------
  
  - Re-visit reliance on Node
      - consider pattern in zope.app.content, marking element interfaces like
        ILoggerAction with an IInterface like IRuleActionType
      - queryType() can find such interfaces
      - the interface may tell us enough about a type
          - how to get name, description of the element type?
          - how to get edit view (can rely on edit.html convention)
 
  - Consider option for making conditions "any" rather than "all"
      - Would imply that conditions and actions be strongly separated at
        the plone.contentrules level.
