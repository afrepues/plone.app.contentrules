plone.app.contentrules TODO

 Design
 ------
 
  - Re-visit reliance on Node
      - consider pattern in zope.app.content, marking element interfaces like
        ILoggerAction with an IInterface like IRuleActionType
      - queryType() can find such interfaces
      - the interface may tell us enough about a type
          - how to get name, description of the element type?
          - how to get edit view (can rely on edit.html convention)

 Views
 -----
 
  - UI for listing, adding, removing, re-ordering, editing elements in a rule
  - UI for deleting, re-ordering rules
      - order of execution may matter!
      
  Temporary views:
  
  List rules, rule add link, rule edit link: /folder/@@listrules
  Add a Logger action to the first rule: /folder/++rule++0/+element/plone.actions.Logger
  Edit first element in first rule: /folder/++rule++0/++elemeent++0/edit.html
  
  (adjust indexes as appropriate)
